# Dashboard 

I made this dashboard as [an assignment for the Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-intermediate-html-and-css-admin-dashboard).

I was planning to replicate this [beautiful dashboard UI](https://dribbble.com/shots/17171504-Project-Management-Dashboard-UI-Concept).

- I used Grid a lot but I still find finding Flexbox easier to use.
- I used variables from [Open Props](https://open-props.style) for the first time and it wasâ€¦ a learning curve. I enjoyed it for the most part.
- I tried to commit more often and more meaningfully but that's a challenge.
- I need to organize my CSS in a better way.


NOTE: The reason why I only did the left and middle panel and didn't finish the last one is because I started seeing too many inconsistency and other UI problems, and it was driving me nuts. And at this point, I believe I had gotten enough from the assignment.
